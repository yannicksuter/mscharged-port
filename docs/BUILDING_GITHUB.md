# GitHub builds

`main` contains development work. `stable` holds reviewed snapshots, promoted
through a `main` → `stable` pull request. A stable snapshot is still a work in
progress until the game is complete.

The **Build binaries** workflow checks PRs targeting `stable`. After a merge
into `stable`, successful Linux x86_64 and macOS Apple Silicon jobs upload
archives under **Actions → Build binaries → run → Artifacts**, retained for
14 days. Manual runs validate the selected branch; only `stable` publishes
binary archives. Failed checks may attach configuration logs. These are unsigned
development builds, not tagged GitHub Releases.

Windows is explicitly skipped in the workflow. Its
module loading, pointer ABI and host services need implementation before it
can produce game binaries. The README build badge reports the `stable` workflow;
it covers Linux and macOS builds. A successful
compile does not establish gameplay or hardware compatibility.

Extract the downloaded `.tar.gz`, keep both runtime modules and `assets/`
beside the executable, and run with your own disc:

```sh
./mscharged --disc /path/to/R4QE01.rvz --window
```

Game data, personal settings and saves are excluded. Linux builds use Ubuntu
26.04/GCC 15 and need compatible system libraries plus a Vulkan driver. macOS
builds use macOS 15/Apple Clang and need Metal. These archives are not
self-contained installers.

## Initial repository setup

Rename the old `master` branch to `stable` using GitHub's branch settings.
The workflow and this policy enter that branch with the first reviewed PR;
merely renaming the old branch does not promote current development code.
Protect `stable` against direct pushes and require PR review and the Linux/macOS
build checks. Add Windows as a required check once its runtime is supported.
