# Building the development launcher

`mscharged` opens the graphical launcher, with Game, Display, Audio, Controls,
and About pages. It uses SDL3 for the window, rendering, file dialogs, and
controller input, and Dear ImGui for the interface. Normal builds keep Play
disabled. The optional `startup` preset provides **Try startup** for an early
original-code path that stops before a menu; see below.

The separate `mscharged-bootstrap` target compiles three available decompilation
translation units:
`src/NL/nlEndian.cpp`, `src/NL/nlRandom.cpp`, and
`src/Game/Core/mtRandom.cpp`. It runs small native utility checks and uses nod
to identify ISO/RVZ images and open their game data partition. It does not
render graphics or run a match.

The decompilation is incomplete and not fully linked. Missing functions,
unfinished reconstructions, console assembly, Wii services, and incompatible
layouts will be handled incrementally. A passing bootstrap build is evidence
for this source subset only. The first 100% decompilation and 100% link release
is a future upstream milestone, not a prerequisite for working on this setup.

## Requirements

- Git, including submodule support.
- Python 3.10 or newer; no third-party Python packages are needed.
- CMake 3.25 or newer.
- Ninja for the supplied presets, or another CMake-supported tool for a manual build.
- C and C++20 compilers. The foundation and launcher use C++17; native asset
  readers and Aurora use C++20. The initial utilities were validated with Clang and GCC
  on Linux; the launcher and disc reader were validated with GCC 16.
- Rust and Cargo 1.85 or newer for nod; validated with Rust 1.95 on Linux.
- The platform prerequisites listed in the pinned SDL source's
  [build instructions](../extern/sdl/docs/README-cmake.md). On Linux, install
  `pkg-config` and the development packages for the desktop backends you use
  (X11 and/or Wayland, including xkbcommon, plus the relevant graphics libraries).
  See SDL's [Linux notes](../extern/sdl/docs/README-linux.md) for distribution
  package lists. SDL itself is built from the pinned submodule.

Windows and macOS are port targets. Their build commands are provided for
development but have not yet been executed on those systems. Qt and Aurora/Dawn
are not needed for this launcher. Building, tests, and the bootstrap's
`--self-test` need no game data.

With CMake 4.4+, the SDL integration explicitly selects its expected legacy
macro escaping for policy `CMP0219`. This is scoped to the pinned SDL build;
ordinary CMake warnings stay enabled and the SDL submodule remains unchanged.

The first nod build downloads the Rust crates recorded in its committed
`Cargo.lock`. Cargo runs with `--locked` and cannot silently update those
versions. Compression libraries are currently built from Cargo's pinned source
crates with support for Bzip2, LZMA/LZMA2, zlib, and Zstandard. Subsequent builds
can use the Cargo cache offline (`CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true`).

## Fetch the source

From a checkout of this repository, initialize the dependencies used by the
launcher and bootstrap at their recorded commits:

```sh
git submodule update --init --checkout extern/mscharged-decomp extern/nod extern/corrosion extern/sdl extern/imgui
```

To also download all top-level library sources for runtime and UI development:

```sh
git -c submodule.recurse=false submodule update --init --checkout
```

The [dependency inventory](../extern/README.md) explains nested dependencies and
remaining integration work. Dawn has a large set of nested development and
platform dependencies; full recursive initialization is unnecessary for this
development build. Ordinary builds do not fetch or advance upstream revisions.

## Build and run

From the repository root, one command configures the Release build, prepares
patched sources, compiles, and runs all six test suites:

```sh
cmake --workflow --preset release
```

The `release` preset selects compiler optimizations. It builds the launcher and
bootstrap with the development scope described above.

On Linux and macOS:

```sh
./build/release/mscharged
```

This opens the launcher. `mscharged --version` prints the version without
opening a window. `--help` lists the supported arguments.

### Launcher settings

- **Game:** browse for an ISO/RVZ, or drop a file onto the window. Disc checks run
  in the background and report its ID, revision, format, and file count.
- **Display:** resolution, aspect ratio, fullscreen, VSync, and backend preferences.
- **Audio:** master, music, and effects volume, plus mute.
- **Controls:** preferred input, deadzone, vibration, and a live check of the
  first detected controller's left stick and face buttons. Wii mappings are pending.
- **About:** build information and attribution.

Display, audio, and gameplay input settings are stored for future runtime
integration; they do not configure a running game or the launcher window.
The experimental startup build uses the saved game text language for the original
USA selection branch; localization assets are not loaded yet.
Backend choices are platform-specific: Linux offers Automatic/Vulkan, macOS
Automatic/Metal, and Windows Automatic/Direct3D 12/Vulkan. See the
[runtime plan](RUNTIME.md#graphics-backend-policy) for their intended behavior.

**Game text language** is intended to select the game's menus and on-screen
text. Charged's startup code reads the Wii system language and selects regional
localization files. The USA release uses English, French, or Spanish; Europe
uses English, French, Spanish, German, or Italian; Japan selects Japanese.
After a successful disc check, the launcher offers the choices for that release.
An existing unsupported preference is retained with a message to choose another.
Unrecognized regions leave the selector disabled. This setting does not translate
the launcher or modify the image. `auto` is reserved for using the computer's
language with a supported regional fallback once runtime integration is in place.

**Save settings** writes the local INI. **Reload** discards unsaved changes and
reads it again. **Defaults** resets preferences while keeping your selected disc;
save to make that change permanent. Closing with unsaved changes offers Save,
Discard, or Cancel. Comments and unknown settings are preserved; an external
edit requires Reload before the launcher will overwrite the file.

The launcher first uses `mscharged.ini` in the working directory. Otherwise it
finds the repository root from its executable location, or falls back to the
executable directory outside a checkout. If there is no INI, it starts with
defaults and creates a file only on Save. An explicit path is also supported:

```sh
./build/release/mscharged --config "/path/to/local.ini"
```

The header image, font, and asset notices are copied beside the executable in
`assets/launcher/`. Keep this directory with the executable if moving a build.

## Configure your disc

1. Put your ISO or RVZ in `game/`, for example `game/R4QE01.rvz`. All contents
   except the `.gitkeep` placeholder are ignored by Git.
2. Select it in the launcher and click **Save settings**. For manual setup, copy
   `mscharged.ini.example` to `mscharged.ini` (`cp` on Linux/macOS or `Copy-Item`
   in PowerShell). The personalized file is ignored by Git.
3. Set `[game] disc` to your image's path. Relative paths start at the INI's
   directory; absolute paths also work. Paths containing spaces may be quoted.
   Save the INI as UTF-8; a UTF-8 BOM and CRLF line endings are accepted.
4. Open `./build/release/mscharged` and use **Check disc**; an existing configured
   disc is checked automatically on startup.

Example configuration:

```ini
[game]
disc = game/R4QE01.rvz
```

The diagnostic CLI can check a disc without opening the launcher:

```sh
./build/release/mscharged-bootstrap --disc "/path/to/Mario Strikers Charged.iso"
./build/release/mscharged-bootstrap --config "/path/to/local.ini"
./build/release/mscharged-bootstrap --self-test
```

ISO and RVZ are opened directly by nod using their contents to detect the format.
Neither the source image nor the decomp checkout is modified. The check reports
the disc ID, revision, format, title, and game file count. A missing/unreadable
image, another game's disc, or an unusable data partition produces an error.
This is a metadata/readability check, not a full-disc checksum verification.

The source baseline is USA `R4QE01`, disc revision 1. Other Charged discs can
be inspected, with a message that their asset compatibility is unverified.
A successful check still does not run the game. ISO reading is tested with a
generated Wii fixture; RVZ reading was also checked with a local USA revision 1
image, reading a file table containing 2,354 game files.

### Windows

Use a Visual Studio developer PowerShell with the C++ tools, Python, CMake, and
Ninja available. CMake can select the compiler provided by that environment:

```powershell
cmake --workflow --preset release
.\build\release\mscharged.exe
```

### Debug and incremental builds

For a build with debug information:

```sh
cmake --workflow --preset debug
./build/debug/mscharged
```

On Windows, run `.\build\debug\mscharged.exe` instead. Debug and Release
outputs use separate directories, so both can coexist. After editing sources,
you can rebuild and test separately:

```sh
cmake --build --preset debug
ctest --preset debug
```

Use `release` in both commands for the Release configuration. To choose a
compiler, set it on the first configuration of that directory, for example:

```sh
cmake --preset debug -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
cmake --build --preset debug
ctest --preset debug
```

Manual configuration remains supported, including existing `build/` directories:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Use a separate build directory when changing compilers. Supported local output
locations are `build/`, `build-*/`, `cmake-build-*/`, or `out/` inside the checkout.
These directories are ignored by Git. In-source builds are rejected.

To build only the diagnostic tools on a machine without desktop prerequisites:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/headless -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DMSCHARGED_BUILD_LAUNCHER=OFF
cmake --build build/headless
ctest --test-dir build/headless --output-on-failure
```

This configuration needs only the decomp, nod, and Corrosion submodules and runs
five suites, omitting `launcher_smoke`.

## Aurora host integration

The optional `aurora` preset also builds `mscharged-aurora-check` and a seventh
test suite for Aurora core services. It requires a C++20 compiler and additional
pinned submodules. It does not enable GX/Vulkan rendering or game startup.
See [the setup and next runtime milestones](RUNTIME.md).

## Independent Vulkan rendering

The Linux `graphics` preset builds a separate `mscharged-gx-check`, using
prepared Aurora GX, Dawn, image/font libraries, and a generated SQLite
amalgamation. It requires C++20, GNU Make, Tcl, and additional nested sources.
See [the dependency setup and commands](RUNTIME.md#independent-gxvulkan-diagnostic).
It renders generated geometry/textures without game data. It does not build the
launcher or connect original game graphics startup.

## Experimental static asset rendering

The Linux `scene` preset combines the launcher, Aurora GX/Vulkan, Aurora DVD,
and the original core/NL file services. Initialize the graphics dependencies
listed in [RUNTIME.md](RUNTIME.md#independent-gxvulkan-diagnostic), then:

```sh
CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=4 cmake --workflow --preset scene
./build/scene/mscharged --experimental-scene --config ./mscharged.ini
```

This loads the ball's actual static mesh, textures and selected original material
program from your USA
`R4QE01` revision 1 ISO/RVZ. It is an asset preview; original scene initialization,
stadium lighting/shadows, animation, menus, and gameplay remain pending. Escape or close
the window to exit. `--frames 180` makes the check bounded. Without the
experimental flag, the same executable opens the normal launcher.
Personal settings and disc contents are read without modification; generated
GPU caches and the diagnostic log stay under `build/scene/scene-data/`.
The preview currently uses its own camera, window, and validated Vulkan settings.
It now runs the original `PreInitFS` memory callback and renders pool-owned
native records through the original static model/texture inventory. Full
`glStartup` and the complete original loaders/material/task graph remain pending.
Four material programs run their original unlit TEV recipes, including scrolling
and masked specular/Fresnel effects. Required lookup textures come from the disc.

The workflow runs ten portable suites. To include four real GPU suites,
including synthetic material pixel checks and disc rendering/failure/cleanup checks:

```sh
cmake --preset scene -DMSCHARGED_TEST_VULKAN=ON
cmake --build --preset scene
ctest --preset scene
```

See [the supported asset profile](RUNTIME.md#experimental-static-wii-asset-preview)
for file formats, limitations, and optional model selection.

## Experimental game startup

With the Aurora dependencies initialized, build and run the original-code
prototype using:

```sh
cmake --workflow --preset startup
./build/startup/mscharged --experimental-startup --config ./mscharged.ini
```

Run `./build/startup/mscharged` without the flag to open the launcher and use
**Try startup** after checking a USA `R4QE01` revision 1 image. This preset adds
eight suites to the Aurora preset, for fifteen total, and writes startup diagnostics
under `build/startup/startup-data/`. Original MEM1/MEM2 allocator and reserved
SDK heap initialization complete, and original NL APIs read disc files both
synchronously and asynchronously. Native animation key decoders are linked and
original `InitializeCore()` / `nlInit()` complete. Native whole-file async loading
also compares the complete `ini/common.ini` and `ini/datetime.ini` bytes with
synchronous reads. Original INI parsing is not executed. The current expected
stop is exit code 3 at `Initialize (remaining stages)`; this prototype's original graphics/resource startup and task loop remain pending.
The separate scene preset enables the bounded static asset preview above.
No menu or match is reached. See [the implemented path and checks](RUNTIME.md#experimental-original-startup).

## Build versions

The current version is `0.0.1-dev`, defined in the root `CMakeLists.txt`.
Every executable includes the port commit in this form:

```text
0.0.1-dev+g<commit>
0.0.1-dev+g<commit>.dirty
```

`<commit>` is the abbreviated port Git revision, normally 12 hexadecimal
characters. `.dirty` indicates uncommitted tracked changes, untracked files
that Git does not ignore, or submodule changes. Ignored local files and build
outputs do not affect the version. The revision and change status refresh on
each build, including incremental builds after a commit.

The executable also reports its Debug or Release configuration. The port's
version is independent of the decompilation's planned `1.0` release; a normal
bootstrap run prints the exact decomp revision separately. These development
builds do not require a release tag.

## What happens before compilation

1. Read the enabled dependencies' gitlinks from the port's
   Git index and require those exact checkouts. On a fresh clone these are the committed pins;
   during an intentional dependency update they are the newly staged pins.
2. Reject tracked edits inside the dependency. Ignored and untracked local
   files are not exported.
3. Export committed sources, including any required initialized nested
   submodules at their pins, to a temporary build directory.
   The graphics preset selects seven direct Dawn gitlinks explicitly; their
   recursive pins and that selection are included in the manifest/cache key.
   Dependencies without a selection require all recorded nested sources.
   For the decomp, export only `include/`, `libs/`, and `src/`; patches must stay
   within those directories. The complete submodule remains the upstream
   reference, including its notices and decomp metadata.
4. Validate each patch base and apply its series in order. The decomp series
   adapts native utilities; the nod series enforces the Cargo lockfile.
   A failure prevents publication of that dependency's prepared tree.
5. Publish `<build-dir>/prepared/<dependency>/source/` and a manifest
   recording commits, ordered patch hashes, preparation-tool hash, and generated
   contents. For the Release preset, `<build-dir>` is `build/release`.
6. Configure the selected source list. Before each build, verify that the
   recorded inputs and generated contents still match.

When refreshing a verified clean prepared tree, identical regular files retain
their timestamps so a focused patch change does not rebuild every source.
Content hashes, executable modes, and input checks remain authoritative.

CMake watches the patch directory, preparation script, and Git index. If a
manual dependency checkout or generated edit causes validation to fail, resolve
the reported mismatch and configure again. An old executable may remain on disk
after a failure; it is not a successful build of the new inputs.

Manual preparation and verification are also available:

```sh
python3 tools/prepare_sources.py --build-dir build/release
python3 tools/prepare_sources.py --build-dir build/release --check
```

Use the same build directory when preparing sources, exporting patches, and
compiling. On Windows, use `python` if that is the installed command name.
Add `--dependency nod`, `--dependency corrosion`, `--dependency sdl`, or
`--dependency imgui` to work with those sources.
nod's Corrosion FetchContent request uses our prepared local submodule.

The selected launcher image is copied to `<build-dir>/assets/launcher/header.png`.
Its [source attribution](../assets/launcher/README.md) is separate from the port's
CC0 code. The launcher displays it with its proportions preserved, cropping
vertically as needed to fit the window.

## Tests and development scope

`foundation` checks fixed-width types, vector layouts, endian conversion,
deterministic random values, range handling, and the portable absolute-value
helper. The MT source currently exposes seed initialization only; there is no
claim of a complete MT implementation or game simulation validation.

`static_resources` checks bounded static Wii model/texture conversion using
synthetic file records: big endian fields, 32-byte chunk alignment, matrix/UV
semantics, GX tile/mip/palette sizes, malformed/truncated inputs, unsupported
profiles, and allocation budgets. It does not validate original scene rendering.

`graphics_memory` (startup/scene) checks the selected original graphics pools,
aligned frame halves, arena ownership, failed construction/allocation cleanup,
nested static inventories, original AVL trees, texture indices, and repeated
shutdown. `static_inventory` (scene) checks pool-owned native model/texture
records, original lookup, unchanged tiled/palette bytes, GPU drain callbacks,
and failed-conversion rollback. Both use synthetic data without a GPU or disc.

`graphics_state` (startup/scene) checks pointer-sized matrix handles across model
packets and saved/global state, active frame/resource bounds, invalid handles,
allocation failure, packed Wii texture word ordering, raster defaults/fields,
original camera/projection/matrix math, and repeated arena recovery. These are
native graphics checks; Wii floating-point and gameplay parity remain pending.

`source_preparation` uses disposable local Git fixtures. It checks ordered
patches, cache reuse, pin/base validation, tracked changes, excluded local data,
failed preparation, stale/edited output, patch export, nested submodules,
explicit nested selections, clean-refresh timestamps, and the restricted decomp
export (19 cases).

`bootstrap_cli` checks INI setup, relative paths, spaces, BOM/CRLF handling,
ISO data-partition access, wrong-game rejection, missing partitions, malformed
images, and command-line errors. It generates a small synthetic Wii image
containing original test data; no proprietary disc contents are needed.

`configuration` checks settings round trips, preserved comments and unknown keys,
validation, explicit file creation, and protection against overwriting external edits.

`launcher_smoke` opens a hidden SDL window using the dummy video and software
render drivers, loads the shipped assets, renders all five pages, and exits.
It needs neither a display server nor game data. To capture a page for review:

```sh
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_RENDER_DRIVER=software ./build/release/mscharged --screenshot build/launcher.png --page display
```

To run only the preparation suite:

```sh
python3 -B tests/test_prepare_sources.py
```

Original scene/task rendering, further startup integration, gameplay, complete game
linking, and packaging remain development work. Add source units and checks
deliberately as the decomp becomes usable.
See [patch development](../patches/README.md) before editing generated sources.
